# Disclosure

A disclosure is a widget that enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or
expanded (visible).

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/disclosure" />

<Showcase id="Disclosure" />

**Features**

- Full keyboard navigation.
- Can collapse or expand content.

## Installation

To use the disclosure machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="disclosure/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic disclosure logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the disclosure correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="disclosure" />

On a high level, the disclosure consists of:

- **Button**: The control for the disclosure content
- **Disclosure**: The section of content whose visibility is controlled by the
  button

## Usage

First, import the disclosure package into your project

```jsx
import * as disclosure from "@zag-js/disclosure"
```

The disclosure package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the disclosure widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
disclosure machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="disclosure/usage.mdx" />

## Disabling the button

To disable the disclosure button, set `disable` to `true`. This ensures that
each the disclosure content will not be expanded or collapsed when the button is
activated.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  disclosure.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Open by default

To set the disclosure content to be opened initially, pass the `open` property
to the machine function.

```jsx {4,5,12}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  disclosure.machine({
    open: true,
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each disclosure part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and closed state

When an disclosure is open or expanded, a `data-state` attribute is set on the
button and content elements. This attribute is removed when it is closed.

```css
[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for the content in open or closed state */
}

[data-part="button"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for the button in open or closed state */
}
```

### Focused state

When a disclosure button is focused, a `data-focused` attribute is set on the
button.

```css
[data-part="button"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the button's focus state */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The disclosure's `api` exposes the following methods and properties:

<ApiTable name="disclosure" />
